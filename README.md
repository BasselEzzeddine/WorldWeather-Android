# WorldWeather-Android

A sample Android weather app written in Kotlin which consumes a REST web service, and is based on MVVM architecture.

In this project, I have used :

- Dagger : for dependency injection
- Retrofit : for network calls
- RxJava and RxAndroid : for asynchronous calls
- Robolectric and JUnit : for unit testing
